# Web Development Coding Quiz

This projectis a quiz that test the user's knowledge of coding JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in a limited time. They have 75 seconds to answer 10 questions. Each wrong answer deducts 15 seconds from their total time and their score is saved in the system and can be accessed next time they login.


<br>
In order to achieve this goal, I took the following steps:

1. set a timer which starts when the start button is clicked

2. show the questions and their choices one by one

3. show the correctness of the user's choice

4. deduct 15 seconds for each wrong answer

5. show the result of quiz at the end

6. save the score of the user in local storage

7. show the high score of user

8. clear the high score upon request
